    <div>
        Problem 1. Increase array members<br />
        Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5.
        Print the obtained array on the console.
        <br />Run increaseArrayMembers() in the console.
    </div>
    <div>
        Problem 2. Lexicographically comparison<br />
        Write a script that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
        <br />Run lexicographicallyComparison() in the console.
    </div>
    <div>
        Problem 3. Maximal sequence<br />
        Write a script that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.
        <br />Run maximalSequene(sequence) in the console // enter a sequence of numbers
    </div>
    <div>
        Problem 4. Maximal increasing sequence<br />
        Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array.
        <br />Run maximalIncreasingSequence(arr) in the console // enter an array of numbers
    </div>
    <div>
        Problem 5. Selection sort<br />
        Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order.
        Write a script to sort an array.
        Use the selection sort algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.
        <br />Run selectionSort(arr) in the console // enter an array of numbers
    </div>
    <div>
        Problem 6. Most frequent number<br />
        Write a script that finds the most frequent number in an array.
        <br />Run mostFrequentNumber(arr) in the console // enter an array of numbers
    </div>
    <div>
        Problem 7. Binary search<br />
        Write a script that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the binary search algorithm.
        <br />Run binarySearch(inputArray, numbersToFind) in the console // enter an array of numbers and array of numbers to find or just run the function without arguments, it'll use a standart input writen in the console
